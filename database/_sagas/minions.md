The Minions universe is a colorful, hilarious animated franchise that began with the "Despicable Me" series, featuring adorable, gibberish-speaking yellow creatures who have captured the hearts of children and adults worldwide. These comical, overall-wearing characters originated as the bumbling yet lovable henchmen of supervillains, most notably Gru, the protagonist of the original films voiced by Steve Carell. Throughout their cinematic adventures, the Minions have become global pop culture icons, starring in their own standalone movie that explored their chaotic history of serving various villainous masters throughout different historical eras. Their unique language, a blend of multiple real-world languages mixed with nonsensical sounds, combined with their slapstick humor and endearing personality, has made them a merchandising phenomenon and a beloved character franchise. The Minions' universal appeal transcends language barriers, making them a successful animated property that continues to entertain audiences through movies, merchandise, and short-form content.
